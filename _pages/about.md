I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Bath.   

My primary research is to develop and apply big data analytical and machining learning algorithms on consumer energy data. The goal is to investigate and extract the underlying patterns from the raw data and develop practical applications such as consumer segmentation and load forecasting.   

I am also interested in local energy systems and Home Energy Management System (HEMS).
